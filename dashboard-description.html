              The dashboard is comprised of multiple components, which, when combined with your organization's data provides an overview of the health of your operations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Click the <img src="images/select_context.png" /> drop-down and you will see a group of countries listed. You can drill down further to states, counties and cities as well. Make a selection by clicking the <strong>OPEN</strong> button. A time series component will then appear on your dashboard. The <strong>Context Browser</strong> and <strong>Time Series Component</strong> have been filled by example data to illustrate how you may add, select and view, your organization's own asset hierarchy and monitoring components.
